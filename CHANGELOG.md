# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Reworked tracking to cover all visible application windows instead of only the frontmost window.
- Added WindowServer window-ID matching and high-frequency position synchronization during drags.
- Kept native button centers stable while a window is moving to avoid stale accessibility coordinates.
- Matched native activation behavior: the active window stays colored, while background windows use AppKit's inactive control color and regain color on hover.
- Rechecked each traffic light's occlusion on every 120 Hz position sample so covered controls disappear during window movement.
- Reconciled hover state against the live pointer position so a dragged panel cannot remain colored after moving away from the pointer.
- Applied occlusion per button so a foreground window hides only the traffic lights it actually covers.
- Added persistent per-button actions, including quitting or hiding the target application.
- Hid overlays before minimization begins and restored them only after the window leaves the Dock.
- Kept WindowServer position and occlusion sampling at a continuous 120 Hz for predictable real-time tracking.
- Added independently adjustable spacing for the three circular macOS traffic-light controls.
- Added an enabled-by-default hidden traffic-light mode that reveals enlarged controls near the window corner.
